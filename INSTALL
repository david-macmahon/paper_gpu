To build the paper_gpu HASHPIPE plugin from a freshly cloned repository you
need to have following pre-requisites installed:

HASHPIPE
xGPU
autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool) [building-only]

The autotools tools are only needed for the build process; they are not needed
at runtime.

Once those are in place, your can run the following commands to build HASHPIPE:

$ cd src
$ autoreconf -is
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

The generated configure script supports the following options that can be used
when HASHPIPE and/or xGPU are installed in non-standard locations:

--with-hashpipe=DIR
--with-xgpu=DIR

Example:

If xGPU is installed under "/usr/local/xgpu16_256_32_titan", you can tell
configure to find it there like this:

$ ./configure --with-xgpu=/usr/local/xgpu-1080-dp4a

If you need to build xGPU, it is included as a git submodule in this repository.
Go into the xGPU/src directory and run (eg, for HERA H2C):
make clean
make NSTATION=192 NFREQUENCY=384 NTIME=2048 NTIME_PIPE=1024 CUDA_ARCH=sm_61 DP4A=yes
sudo make install prefix=/usr/local/xgpu-1080-dp4a
